# bevy-snake
This is just a simple game that I made to get familiar with the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) language and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) framework.

The project was made following this [tutorial](https://mbuffett.com/posts/bevy-snake-tutorial/).

## How to run;

Install rust/cargo, I install via [asdf](https://github.com/code-lever/asdf-rust).

Clone the repository.
And run:
```sh
cargo run
```

You should see something like:
